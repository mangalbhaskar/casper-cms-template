- Licensing & Fees
**What are the licensing options?**
CyberCity 3D currently offers 2 licenses for our 3D Streaming Maps:
1. Basic License
	* This is our most common licensing, and is intended for clients that desire a turnkey solution to visualize and stream their data on Cesium. Let CyberCity 3D take care of the setup, hosting, and streaming of your map. This license includes a setup fee, as well as a standard annual streaming fee.
2. Developer License
	* This is intended for clients who have the desire and ability to download Cesium and create a Streaming 3D Map themselves. This option gives you the freedom to customize your solution as much as you can develop it. There is no setup fee involved-- only an annual streaming fee for access to an API key for high resolution streaming buildings. 
**How does CyberCity 3D produce the high resolution 3D building models?**
	* We create our models using our patent-pending photogrammetric modeling software-- the core of our technology stack. This semi-automatic process begins with the acquisition of stereo-imagery. From there, point clouds are created, which are then formed into our 3D buildings . Finally, the models are exported into one of several leading 3D formats.
**Does CyberCity 3D capture the stereo imagery?**
	* No, we do not capture our source imagery . Depending on the city modeled, we acquire the imagery files from either the local municipality, or third party imagery  endors. The source imagery is captured from either aircraft or satellite. If imagery is not available offthe-shelf, we can contract a new flight over an area from a vendor.

**3D Data**
- 3D Buildings
- Other 3D Objects
	* tree models, billboards, street culture, and proposed property development
- Terrain:  Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
 	* upload your own Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
	* Terrains provide realistic elevation changes on which all other layers will "sit", adding to the real-world accuracy of a map
- Imagery:  base imagery of a map.
	* upload your own high resolution orthophotos for proprietary imagery visualization
- Temporal Data
	* stream various timedependent layers
	* data objects that change over time (such as the position of a satellite)
	* Cesium includes a timeline feature that enables  users to see movement or modifications in information throughout a given period.
-  building a streaming map for clients

**models can be created from:**
- photogrammetry information
- aerial LiDAR
- oblique imagery

**Applications**
* ARCHITECTURE & CITY DESIGN
	- Highly accurate models produced for planning consultations to raise the profile of the city development schemes.
* ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
	- 3D models are currently playing a large role in a range of environmental studies, creating valuable information for noise mapping and flood mapping.
* BIM MODELLING
	- Customised 3D models provide the foundations for BIM by creating a spatial reference in which to allow a wealth of non-spatial data to be attached and analysis and rapid prototyping to be completed.
* TOURISM
	- Various forms of 3D models and landmark creations are currently being used for tourism visualisations, as illustrations in brochures, on road signs, advertisements and within tourism videos.
	- VIRTUAL CITIES & TOURISM GUIDES
* NAVIGATION
* TELECOMS INFRASTRUCTURE
	- LOD 1 & LOD 2 provides high resolution city models that can be used for radio planning design in urban environments.
* Others
- Traditional uses currently involves Blom3D being used for planning purposes, new applications for the models has seen them become invaluable in gaming and interactive multimedia guides

**CAD Vector Maps**
planning, engineering, construction, environmental applications, business solutions, forestry, farming as well as supporting additional data needs and services.

- Positional Accuracy Improvements (PAI)
**LoD**
http://blomasa.com/main-menu/products-services/mapping-modelling/3d-city-models-en.html#/main-menu/products-services/data-models-blomurbex/blom3dtrade.html

- Blom currently has in excess of 340 detailed urban models, covering more than 12,000 km² and detailing more than 20 million buildings

The Blom3D models have four different LODs (level of detail), ranging from simple wire frames to fully textured models. This flexible range of LOD allows Blom’s clients to choose which level of detail they require for their specific purposes.

The Blom3D™ product family contains the following layers/components:

BlomLOD1 - Building blocks minus roof detail
BlomLOD2- Building blocks with large scale roof detail with approximation of colour derived from the LOD4 textures.
BlomLOD3- Building blocks with large scale roof detail plus standard format library textures based on  colour and representation of real features
BlomLOD4 - Building blocks with large scale roof detail plus Photo-realistic textures from aerial imagery
BlomLANDMARKS - High resolution 3D representations of specific landmarks completed with Photo-realistic textures
BlomNAVIGATION - Dataset of road features and other elements generated for routing, navigation and representation purposes.
