## **Virtual Machine, Docker Containers**
> Using **pre-configured** and **building your own** VM and Containers

Once you have mastered and created your arsenal of tools and softwares creating VM, containers is a good idea for quick replica.
- IT provides for quick start
- Saves lot of time in fixing for broken dependencies due to incompatibility across different updates across different dependent software components.
- It's an addon valued skill gives you an edge
